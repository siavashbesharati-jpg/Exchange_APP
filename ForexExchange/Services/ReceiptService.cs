// TODO: Replace with AccountingDocumentService 
// ReceiptService was part of the old Receipt/Transaction-based system
// Should be replaced with AccountingDocumentService that handles the new AccountingDocument model

/*
 * Original ReceiptService removed as part of architectural change
 * from Receipt/Transaction-based system to direct CustomerBalance management.
 * 
 * New AccountingDocumentService should provide:
 * - Process uploaded AccountingDocuments with OCR
 * - Update CustomerBalance and BankAccountBalance records directly
 * - Handle document verification and approval workflows
