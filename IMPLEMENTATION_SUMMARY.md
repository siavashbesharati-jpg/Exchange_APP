# Implementation Summary - Multi-Currency Cross-Trading Exchange System

## ‚úÖ Current Status (Aug 22, 2025): Cross-Currency Trading + Role-Gated Orders

### üåê Multi-Currency Cross-Trading Implementation
- Updated Business Model: Full cross-currency trading; IRR is base for cross-rate fallback
- Currency Pool Enhancement: All currencies (including IRR) managed in separate pools
- Cross-Currency Exchange Rates: Direct, reverse, and IRR cross calculations
- Advanced Risk Management: Risk indicators via pool stats (service-level)
- Pool Balance Monitoring: Pools updated on each Transaction
- Dynamic Rate Calculation: Rate chosen as best available for both parties during matching

### üîß Technical Architecture Updates
- Models Updated:
  - Removed legacy `CurrencyType` enum. Introduced DB-backed `Currency` entity and navigation props (`FromCurrency`, `ToCurrency`) in `Order`/`Transaction`.
  - `Order`: cross-currency pair support, `FilledAmount`, `TotalInToman` for reporting.
  - `Transaction`: status machine (Pending ‚Üí PaymentUploaded ‚Üí ReceiptConfirmed ‚Üí Completed/Failed).
- Services:
  - `CurrencyPoolService` updates pools on transaction creation and tracks risk-levels.
  - `TransactionSettlementService` handles settlement lifecycle and notifications.
  - `SettingsService` provides commission/exchange fees and operational thresholds.
- Controllers:
  - `OrdersController`: Admin/Manager/Staff only. Creates orders with direct/reverse/IRR cross-rate selection and performs matching (supports partial fills).
  - `ReceiptsController`: Upload + OCR + verification; ties to transactions.
  - `SettlementsController`: Initiate/confirm/complete/fail settlement steps.
  - `ReportsController`: Financial/Commission/OrderBook/CustomerActivity.
  - `CurrenciesController`: Admin management (Create/Edit/ToggleActive; no delete; IRR base protected).

### üîê Role & UI Enforcement
- Only Admin/Manager/Staff can create/manage orders. Customer UIs do not expose order creation.
- Dashboard and Home views updated to gate order links by role.

### üíæ Data Seeding
- `DataSeedService.CreatCurencies()` implemented: seeds IRR (sole base) + USD/EUR/AED/OMR/TRY; maintains display data and base constraints.

### üìò Documentation
- New: `BUSINESS_FLOW.md` ‚Äî end-to-end flow with example scenarios (Order ‚Üí Match ‚Üí Receipts ‚Üí Settlement ‚Üí Reports).
- README updated: role-gated order management highlighted; link to Business Flow added.
